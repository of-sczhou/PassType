# PassType
Handy GUI-script for KeePass databases.

This script is designed for system adiministrators, it allows printing credentials from KeePass databases to any consoles - VMware vmrc, Microsoft Hyper-V, HP iLo, Dell iDrac, and so on.

The script does not require Keepass software installed, local or network access to KeePass databases is sufficient.

To operate the program, an external PowerShell module poshkeepass is used. The original module page can be found at https://github.com/PSKeePass/PoShKeePass. For simplicity, the current version of the poshkeepass module is located in the script folder under the same name.
